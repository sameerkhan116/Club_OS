# My Approach to the Project

Use sequelize to create the database as described in the instructions and use graphql for querying the db.
Create a simple registering component (no authentication for now) to create a customer. Any changes that are made in this customers profile shoule be reflected accordingly.
On the front end, show a list of all customers and clicking on each customer should redirect to the customer's profile displaying their current status.
